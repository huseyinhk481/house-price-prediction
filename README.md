Prediction house prices using Python and machine learning (Linear Regression, EDA)
# 🏠 House Price Prediction (Ev Fiyatı Tahmini)

## 📘 Project Overview
This project predicts house prices based on property characteristics such as living area, number of rooms, and neighborhood.  
It uses the **Ames Housing dataset** and applies regression models in Python (scikit-learn).

## ⚙️ Steps
1. Data loading and exploration (EDA)
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Feature encoding
4. Model training (Linear Regression)
5. Model evaluation and visualization

---

## 📊 Tools & Libraries
- Python (Google Colab)
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

---

## 🚀 Results
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** ~25000  
- **R² Score:** ~0.80 (depending on preprocessing)

---

## 💡 Next Steps
- Try advanced models: `RandomForest`, `XGBoost`
- Apply feature selection
- Tune hyperparameters for better accuracy
